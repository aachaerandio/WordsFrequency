# WordsFrequency

This application outputs the individual words that appear in a given book in a text file and how many times that word appears in the text file. 
Ignored punctuation and capitalisation.
Also outputs whether the number of times each word appears is a prime number.

I have used TDD in the approach to writing the application.

I have decided to use a HashMap to solve the problem, containing word as a key and its frequency as the value.
